# ESP32-iot-board-using-EasyEDA
The ESP8266 is an iot board which is famous by the [wroom32] microcontroller.
this card is mainly used to get data and send them to a web server via wifi.
ESP8266 is capable of functioning consistently in industrial environments, due to its wide operating temperature range.
In addition it integrates a Tensilica L106 32-bit RISC processor, which achieves extra-low power consumption and reaches a maximum clock speed of 160 MHz.
All of these in one card that can connect to other microcontrollers using uart or spi communication protocols.
